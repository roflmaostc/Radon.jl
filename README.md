# Outdated Package: Rather use [RadonKA.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/RadonKA.jl)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LMescheder/Radon.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LMescheder/Radon.jl)

This package contains routines to compute the [Radon transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform) of a 2D image and the corresponding back projection. In the future, it might also contain algorithms to invert the Radon transform.

*Note*: this package is in an early stage and presumably subject to substantial change in the future.
